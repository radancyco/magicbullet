00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.392
(cheerful music)

00:00:01.392 --> 00:00:02.976
<v Woman>Every item that we sell</v>

00:00:02.976 --> 00:00:04.356
has to go through many stages

00:00:04.356 --> 00:00:05.906
in supply chain before it ever makes it

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:07.823
to the customer's home.

00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:10.817
Today we sell over 13,000 SKUs

00:00:10.817 --> 00:00:13.233
from over 12 hundred vendors domestically

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:14.900
and internationally.

00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:17.751
With a multi-department effort

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.641
of approximately 8,000 Crate associates,

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.024
we're able to make that happen.

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:25.002
(phone rings)

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:25.835
<v Woman>Thank you for calling</v>

00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:28.389
Crate&amp;Barrel Customer Service, Linda speaking,

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:29.861
how may I help you?

00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:31.130 
<v ->This is Quality Assurance.</v>

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.610
<v ->The Merchandise Liaisons.</v>

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.581
<v ->Workforce.</v>

00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:35.410
<v ->Live Chat. (laughs)</v>

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.320
<v ->I'm in Customer Service.</v>

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.640
<v ->Crate&amp;Barrel Designer Rewards and Gift Registry.</v>

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.918 
<v ->The Email Customer Service.</v>

00:00:40.918 --> 00:00:42.130
<v ->Business Sales.</v>

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.840 
<v ->Of the 1.6 million contacts we have,</v>

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.610
77% of those are phone and 10% are over email

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.061
and 13% are over chat, so we handle all the Crate

00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:56.769
and CB2 in the contact center.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.861 
It's really important to have those associate relationships

00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:02.201
so they know that that's part of the culture

00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:04.560
and they can reinforce that with our customers.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.890
<v ->Well, it's a job.
(woman laughs)

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.530
and somebody has to do it.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.002
<v ->Every day is a different day.</v>

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:12.419
<v ->What don't I love about my job?</v>

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:13.882 
<v ->I love the customers.</v>

00:01:13.882 --> 00:01:15.621
<v ->What's not to like?</v>

00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:17.438
<v ->So the thing I love about it most</v>

00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:19.832
is the associates are just one big huge team

00:01:19.832 --> 00:01:23.112
that want to connect with the customers and with each other

00:01:23.112 --> 00:01:25.083
and with all the other departments and channels

00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:26.414
in the company.

00:01:26.414 --> 00:01:29.583
It's very very important to us to

00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:33.062
know that people feel that we're supporting what they do

00:01:33.062 --> 00:01:35.472
and supporting the business the best way that we can

00:01:35.472 --> 00:01:39.734
and of course providing excellent customer service.

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:41.942
<v Woman>We thank you for making Crate&amp;Barrel a small part</v>

00:01:41.942 --> 00:01:43.213
of your big day.

00:01:43.213 --> 00:01:46.963
You're very welcome, you have a good day now.
