00:00:00 --> 00:00:01
(cheerful music)

00:00:01 --> 00:00:02
Every item that we sell

00:00:02 --> 00:00:04
has to go through many stages

00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
in supply chain before it ever makes it

00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
to the customer's home.

00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
Today we sell over 13,000 SKUs

00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
from over 12 hundred vendors domestically

00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
and internationally.

00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
With a multi-department effort

00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
of approximately 8,000 Crate associates,

00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
we're able to make that happen.

00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
(phone rings)

00:00:25 --> 00:00:25
Thank you for calling

00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
Crate and Barrel Customer Service, Linda speaking,

00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
how may I help you?

00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
This is Quality Assurance.

00:00:31 --> 00:00:32
The Merchandise Liaisons.

00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
Workforce.

00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
Live Chat. (laughs)

00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
I'm in Customer Service.

00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
Crate and Barrel Designer Rewards and Gift Registry.

00:00:39 --> 00:00:40
The Email Customer Service.

00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
Business Sales.

00:00:42 --> 00:00:44 
Of the 1.6 million contacts we have,

00:00:44 --> 00:00:49
77% of those are phone and 10% are over email

00:00:49 --> 00:00:54
and 13% are over chat, so we handle all the Crate

00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
and CB2 in the contact center.

00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
It's really important to have those associate relationships

00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
so they know that that's part of the culture

00:01:02 --> 00:01:04
and they can reinforce that with our customers.

00:01:04 --> 00:01:07
Well, it's a job.
(woman laughs)

00:01:07 --> 00:01:09
and somebody has to do it.

00:01:09 --> 00:01:11
Every day is a different day.

00:01:11 --> 00:01:12
What don't I love about my job?

00:01:12 --> 00:01:13
I love the customers.

00:01:13 --> 00:01:15
What's not to like?

00:01:15 --> 00:01:17
So the thing I love about it most

00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
is the associates are just one big huge team

00:01:19 --> 00:01:23
that want to connect with the customers and with each other

00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
and with all the other departments and channels

00:01:25 --> 00:01:26
in the company.

00:01:26 --> 00:01:29
It's very very important to us to

00:01:29 --> 00:01:33
know that people feel that we're supporting what they do

00:01:33 --> 00:01:35
and supporting the business the best way that we can

00:01:35 --> 00:01:39
and of course providing excellent customer service.

00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
We thank you for making Crate and Barrel a small part

00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
of your big day.

00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
You're very welcome, you have a good day now.
