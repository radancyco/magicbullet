GDPR Explicit Consent: Overview of Issues (A Tale of Two GDPR Consents)

1. The Request

	* The client (Duff & Phelps) is looking to disable TB360 until user opts into cookie usage by clicking "Accept" button in banner. This is called "Explicit Consent".
  * Spell implemented this request into the banner script, but ran into (and flagged the possibility of this happening, over a week ago) the following:

2. The Disconnect

  * The dimension we need to target, GDPR Consent, which we are looking to control when banner is engaged with, is actually handled product-side and is sent to Google as soon as page loads.
  * Upon landing on any given page for first time, the value of GDPR Consent is "null", which is sent to Google.
  * When user navigates to another page (or refreshes), a time-stamp value is passed to GDPR Consent, which is then sent to Google.

      * This behavior sits outside of the banner script, which indicates that TalentBrew (TB) has its own programming in place for passive consent. (Is this documented somewhere? Nothing on Confluence.)
      * Because GA works outside of the banner script, there is no way for Spell to intercept this dimension _before_ it is sent to Google.

3. The Possible Solution

  * Instead of passing the GDPR Consent dimension to Google via TB, we can pass the dimension into the data layer, when user clicks on "Accept" button. (Thanks, Bobby!)
  * In order for this happen, the GDPR Consent dimension would need to be removed from TB.

      * Note: The dimension would need to be removed on a client by client basis only.

4. The Ultimate Solution

  Work the banner script into TB itself for easier and more granular control over what is and isn't tracked when user engages with banner.

    * Note: Not holding breath as 2019 Roadmap already in play, but this would likely be most correct way to handle GDPR moving forward. :-)
