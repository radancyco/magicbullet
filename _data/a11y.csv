A11Y001,Images Missing Alt Attributes,New,High,,Career Site (Client Facing),Global,"Our delivery developers and content authors, despite our best efforts to educate them, often forget to include an alt attribute on images. Adding an alt attribute (often called a null alt) to decorative or non-essential images will effectively hide them from assistive technology, creating a more pleasant and less overwhelming experience. Missing alt attributes are also often cited in internal and third-party accessibility, so by automating their inclusion, we eliminate both these issues. Eventually, this solution to missing alt attributes should be included in the Career Site's core scripting.",fixAltAttribute,NA,
A11Y002,Applied Filters Require Several UX/AX Improvements,New,High,,Career Site (Client Facing),Search Results,"Although technically part of the Search Results module, the applied filter buttons at the top of the Search Results page have several issues that are being addressed with this fix. These buttons appear after certain filters are selected or specialized URLs are navigated to. The improvements include more intuitive accessible labels that include the term ""Remove"" and better keyboard management. For example, when a filter is removed, the focus moves to the next adjacent button. If the last filter is removed, the focus shifts to the first search result. The fix also makes several improvements and adjustments to the ARIA used in this section, such as: 

Remove aria-labeledby from UL.
Remove aria-hidden and aria-expanded and add aria-describedby and role to parent element (.search-results-option)",fixAppliedFilter,Required,
A11Y003,Aria-describedby Pointing to Non-Existent IDs,New,Medium,,Career Site (Client Facing),Cookie Management,"Input elements on the Cookie Management page currently include aria-describedby attributes that reference non-existent IDs. If the ID is created later, such as post-validation, the aria-describedby attribute should only be present at that state. For now, we are simply removing this attribute, which may also be the recommended fix for the product team.",fixCookieManagement,NA,
A11Y004,"Data Collection Forms (Job Alert, Talent Community) Require (Many) UX/AX Improvements",New,High,,Career Site (Client Facing),Form (Job Alert),"Many of our data capture forms on the site, such as Job Alerts, have dozens of problems that impact users with disabilities. This fix will address all forms that currently have a class of ""data-form"". These fixes range in nature from addressing improper lableing, to improving validation, general clean-up, and more. This fix address almost two dozen unique issues that will be documented at a later date. ",fixDataForm,Required,
A11Y005,Core Disclosure Functionality Placing aria-expanded on Incorrect Element,New,High,,Career Site (Client Facing),Global,"Some areas of our career site utilize a class called ""expandable-parent"" that incorrectly applies the aria-expanded attribute to itself—the div or section to which the class is applied—instead of to the interactive element, typically a button, where it should actually exist. The aria-expanded attribute only conveys the state of the component (expanded or collapsed) when it is present on the interactive element that toggles it and not its parent element.

Currently, this default functionality can be found in the Seach Filters, though it may appear elsewhere. ",fixGlobalDisclosure,NA,
A11Y006,Iframe Element Improvements,New,Low,,Career Site (Client Facing),Global,"Like images, iframes often need extra information to convey their content. Ideally, this information would always be included, but until then, we can apply a fix to improve the situation. For example, YouTube videos, especially those in CMS-generated content, often lack a title attribute, so this fix will address that specifc issue.",fixIframeElement,Required,
A11Y007,Input Element Improvements,New,Low,,Career Site (Client Facing),Global,"Many input elements that are checkboxes also contain an attribute called autocomplete. Since autocompete invalidates on these kinds of inputs, we need to remove the attribute. Fix may also address other kinds of common input issues. ",fixInputElements,NA,
A11Y008,Job Description Improvements,New,High,,Career Site (Client Facing),Job Details,"CMS-generated content can produce a lot of  access barriers and broken code, so this fix seeks to address several common issues found in ATS job descriptions.",fixJobDescription,NA,
A11Y009,Job List Improvements,New,Medium,,Career Site (Client Facing),Job List,Job Lists should really have the location appear inside of a link so that job links with same title can be more descriptive and discernable.,fixJobList,NA,
A11Y010,Job Location Page Improvements,New,High,,Career Site (Client Facing),Job Location Map,"The form on the job location page has several issues, including usability problems with the map. Keyboard users find the map difficult to navigate. To address this, we suggest providing a link to access the map on Google.com, which is more accessible for keyboard and assistive technology users. Additionally, the primary heading, ""Job Location,"" should specify the exact location being sought.",fixJobLocation,NA,https://app.screencast.com/GvvBKMIwzsuwM
A11Y011,Save Job Button Improvements,New,High,,Career Site (Client Facing),Global,"The ""Save Job"" buttons across Careers Site are not accessible. When activated, the button needs to convey a ""pressed"" state to assistive technologies, indicating whether the button has been activated. The button should consistently display ""Save Job"" to ensure clarity when used together with aria-pressed. Using text to toggle between ""Save Job"" and ""Job Saved"" is ineffective and inaccessible. Therefore, when aria-label is applied, which is also scripted in. it should take precedence over the internal label being toggled and displayed. On this last point, hearing one thing and seeing another may still fail WCAG but the experience is still much improved. Develoeprs and designers should be incouraged not to toggle text to convey state. ",fixSaveJobButton,Required,
A11Y012,Basic Search Form Improvements,New,High,,Career Site (Client Facing),Search Form,"The basic ""Search Form"" has several issues, particularly with the validation of the ""Locations"" field in how it relates to keyboard use. When an invalid location is entered, focus should return to the Location field. This ensures that screen reader users hear the error message beneath it and can tab forward after correcting the error, rather than tabbing backwards if focus is on the error message itself. Additionally, the aria-hidden attribute should be removed from the ""Location Pin"" button. Currently, this fix is only applied to the basic search form. A new function will eventually be created for the Advanced Search Form. ",fixSearchForm,NA,
A11Y013,Search Results Pagination Improvements,New,Medium,,Career Site (Client Facing),Global,"The ""Search Results"" pagination has several issues that need to be addressed. Since the pagination is enclosed in a nav element, it should be properly labeled. Additionally, the ""Next"" and ""Previous"" links should be hidden on the first and last pages to avoid confusion, as they lead nowhere.",fixSearchPagination,Required,
A11Y014,Search Results Section Missing Tabindex,New,Medium,,Career Site (Client Facing),Search Results,"The ""Search Results"" section appears to be missing a tabindex, so this fix will add one. Note:  This may no longer be needed.",fixSearchResults,NA,
A11Y015,Job Location and Job Category Module Headings Contain Tabindexes,New,Medium,,Career Site (Client Facing),Job Location,"Sitemap pages have tabindex applied to certain headings. Inactive elements should never receive focus. These issues affect modules like ""Job Location"" and ""Job Category,"" which are commonly found on the Sitemap page.",fixSitemap,NA,
A11Y016,Social Share Links That Open In New Windows Require Helper Text,New,High,,Career Site (Client Facing),Social Share,The social media share links on most job description pages tend to open in new windows. We need to include helper text to inform assistive technology users of this behavior.,fixSocialShare,Required,
